[craters.js nodejs versionÔ∏è](https://github.com/swashvirus/node-craters.js)
#### Short escription
portability is the main goal of the framework
simple to use micro game framework lightweight and minimal weighing just 2kb zipped and minified includes all you need to get a game up and running in a few lines of code, a loop , update , render. which makes it simple to modify and hackable framework. leaving enough room for the game logic. suitable for [js13kgames](https://js13kgames.com) competition or anyone trying to build a game using a skeleton framework as opposed to complex alternatives
#### Let's Blast Off üöÄ
note the example game is included in the dist folder alternatively you can build it on your own 
`sudo git clone https://github.com/swashvirus/craters.js.git`
`cd ./craters.js && webpack`
#### writing the demo game yourself
```javascript
// load craters
var cg = require('./craters/craters.js');
class mygame extends cg.game {
	init (){
	super.init();
	// now init my game 
	var that = this;
	var w = this.constants.width,
		h = this.constants.hieght;
		
	class comet extends cg.entity {
		// comment */
		constructor (name) {
			super();
			
			this.name = name;
		}
		
		update (){
			// update the comet's shaking moves ,
			this.state.position.x += (Math.random() - 0.5);
			this.state.position.y += (Math.random() - 0.5);
			// 'DOS' console.log(this.name + ' ' + this.type + ' state:' + JSON.stringify(this.state));
		}
		// comment
		render (){
			// draw the entities ,
			that.context.save();
			that.context.font = '64px Impact';
			that.context.fillText('‚òÑÔ∏è', (10 + this.state.position.x) , ((w / 2) + this.state.position.x), (w));
			// comment
			that.context.font = '32px Impact';
			that.context.fillText('It\'s working.Ô∏è', 65, (w / 2), (w));
			that.context.restore();
		}
	}
		
	that.state.entities.comet = new comet('f18');
	
	}
}

window.game = new mygame('#container', window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight, 60, true);
