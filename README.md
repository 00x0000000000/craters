"use strict";
// load craters.js script tag works too
require('./craters/craters.js');

class mygame extends craters.game {
	
	intitiate () {
	
		super.intitiate();
		// now intitiate my game
	}
	
	render () {
	
		super.render(this);
		
		this.context.font = '2em Arial';
		this.context.fillText('It\'s working.Ô∏è', 65, (this.constants.height / 2), (this.constants.width));
	}

window.game = new mygame('#container', window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight, 60, true);
