![](craters.gif)

[craters.js nodejs versionÔ∏è](https://github.com/swashvirus/node-craters.js)

#### Short description
craters.js is a simple to use micro game engine both lightweight and portable so minimal that it's just 1.5kb in size! zipped and minified.
in it, it includes all basics you need to get a game up and running in a few lines of code 
leaving enough room for the game logic. suitable for [js13kgames](https://js13kgames.com) competition

#### structure
container is a method which creates an instance of a game world
the container and entities both have methods update and render

containers have entities and their entities can also have entities as long as they inherit the craters.entity class

#### let's make a game üöÄ
note the example game is included in the dist folder alternatively you can build it on your own 
`sudo git clone https://github.com/swashvirus/craters.js.git`
`cd ./craters.js && webpack`

##### writing the demo game yourself
```javascript
"use strict";
// load craters.js
// script tag works just good as well

require('./craters/craters.js');

class mygame extends craters.container {
	
	intitiate () {
		super.intitiate();
		// now intitiate my game
		// deploy a new comet into the world
		this.state.entities.push( new comet(this, 'f18') );
	}
}

class comet extends craters.entity {
	// extend the entity class
	constructor (scope, name) {
		super();
		this.scope = scope;
		this.type = 'kinematic';
		this.name = name;
		this.state.pos = {x: 0, y: (this.scope.constants.height / 2)}
	}
	
	// executed per frame rate updates the entity
	update (){
		// update the comet's shaking moves ,
		this.state.pos.x += (Math.random() - 0.5);
		this.state.pos.y += (Math.random() - 0.5);
		// 'DOS' console.log(this.name + ' ' + this.type + ' state:' + JSON.stringify(this.state));
	}
	
	// draws the entity on the canvas
	render (){
		this.scope.context.save();
		this.scope.context.font = '64px Arial';
		this.scope.context.fillText('‚òÑÔ∏è', (10 + this.state.pos.x) , (this.state.pos.y), (this.scope.constants.width));
		
		this.scope.context.font = '32px Arial';
		this.scope.context.fillText('It\'s working.Ô∏è', 65, (this.scope.constants.height / 2), (this.scope.constants.width));
		this.scope.context.restore();
	}
}

window.game = new mygame('#container', window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight, 60, true);
```
#### TODO
- mini collision detection
- window resize function built in
- fixing errors
